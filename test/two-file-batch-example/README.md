To run the two file solution:
1.) First place your analyzer in this folder and call it test-Analyzer.py
2.) Next put the Secondary File list in inputFileLst.txt
3.) Create the submit footer files using the commmand ```python dasqueryMiniFEVT.py inputFileList.txt```
For the next step PLEASE run a test job to see that it runs and outputs a file on /hdfs/ before submitting all jobs.
3.) Create and submit the analyzers bash createAnalyzers.sh
